            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
            <br> through some interesting places on the way:
            <ul>
                <li>Walla Walla</li>
                <li>WA</li>
                <li>Magic City</li>
                <li>ID</li>
                <li>Bountiful</li>
                <li>UT</li>
                <li>CO</li>
                <li>NM</li>
                <li>AZ</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            <br>
            <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.
            <br>

            My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
            <br> Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
            <ol>
                <li>cellphone</li>
                <li>iPod</li>
                <li>digital camera</li>
                <li>protein bar</li>
            </ol>
            Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
            <blockquote>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</blockquote>
